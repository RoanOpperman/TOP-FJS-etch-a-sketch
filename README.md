# TOP-FJS-etch-a-sketch
An interactive sketchpad project for practicing DOM manipulation and Flexbox, where users can draw pixelated trails with customizable grids and color effects.
## Key Features
* **Dynamic Grid Generation**: Builds a responsive grid entirely through JavaScript, allowing users to specify grid size (up to 100x100) and ensuring it scales to fit the drawing area smoothly.
* **Hover Effects and Color Transitions**: Each square responds to hover events, changing color to create a visual trail, demonstrating proficiency in event handling and DOM updates.
* **Enhanced Interaction Options**:
  * *Random Color Mode*: Generates unique colors on each interaction.
  * *Progressive Darkening*: Gradually darkens squares with each hover, using opacity for a layered effect.
## Technical Highlights
* **JavaScript**: Event listeners, DOM manipulation, conditional rendering, and color customization.
* **CSS Flexbox**: Grid layout achieved without CSS Grid to reinforce Flexbox skills.
* **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various user inputs while maintaining a consistent overall canvas size, ensuring performance and usability.
